I'm a software engineer with extensive experience in building and
architecting large-scale web applications using different software stacks. My
main focus is developing the best systems that are pleasant to work with for both
developers and users. As well a have comprehensive knowledge of computer science,
especially in a field of programming language design, type systems,
algorithms, programming paradigms, and graphics.

You can also check some of my projects on GitHub: <https://github.com/PunGy>.

The most notable of them is the most recent one, a low-level reactive programming
library: <https://github.com/PunGy/fluid>.

To summarize my expertise:

- Expert knowledge of **OOP**, **FP** and **Reactive Programming**.
- Comprehensive knowledge of **different programming languages** and building
complex projects with them, from the dynamic ones, such as **Common Lisp** and
**JS**, to highly static ones as **Haskell** and **Scala**, as well as low
level languages: the **C/C++** and **Rust**. The full list:
    - Fluent: **JS/TS**.
    - Good level of knowledge: **Go**, **Java**, **Common Lisp**, **Haskell**.
    - Comfortable with: **C/C++**, **Scala**, **Rust**.
- Good **reasoning skills**, extensive experience conducting **researche**,
writing and **presenting proposals**, and collaborating with coworkers to find
the best solution for comples tasks.
- I possess deep knowledge and a high level of competence in the area of UI
systems. I have experience writing **UI for an embedded TV device** and a
complete, full-fledged **word processor**, designing it from the **ground up with a
small team of architects**.
- Extensive **mentoring experience** with groups of people, conducting learning
courses.

# Work experience

## Yandex, Senior Software Engineer

- Oct 2023 - Present
- Moscow, Russia
- TypeScript, React, Reactive Programming(custom mobx), System Architecture, Graphics.

Member of the core R&D team, leading, designing, architecting, and building from
ground up an absolutely new, the most innovative and efficient word
processor: can open and edit a **1000 page document** even on slow computers **IN THE
BROWSER**.

<https://360.yandex.ru/business/documents/>. (beta)

Achievements:

- Leading development of **desktop-version** with Electron. Succesfully adopted
interfaces of web/online-only application to work offline with operating
system and local files, so the key logic of the system is the same in web and desktop.
- Have created a very powerfull and innovative way to access the state of selection
by developing a **domain-specific logic "language"** on top of TypeScript.
- Developed a plugin-based **DevTools framework** together with a
platform-agnostic **graphics library**, to access and print information of
actively running applicaiton, as well as modify it in action. Similar to
Pixi.js DevTools.
- Made a super-efficient **search engine** that can find matches in **1 million
symbols** spread across a highly nested tree of nodes in **less than 300ms**
on **slow computers**, with fully asynchronous 60fps typing, without indexing.

## EPAM Systems, Lead Software Engineer

- Oct 2021 - Oct 2023
- Kraków, Małopolskie, Poland
- TypeScript, React, Embedded UI, Java, Lexical

**1st Project**: UI of the Smart-TV box. It is a large Node.JS
application working on emmbedded device and form a desktop-environment and
working similary to Browser.

**Participation**: Architect and implement abstractions for working with
asynchronous actions. Improved documentation and stabilization of core modules
and increased test coverage. Organized and significantly improved the usability
and performance of core utils used everywhere around the project. Supported and
extended toolset of bash scripts for development (connection, mounting the
code, debugging). Created a benchmark library.

**2nd Project**: The platform for improving the security state of customer
services. Allows to plan the path of security checks, flexibly allocate
resources and specialists, see progress in real-time, and receive feedback with
complete confidentiality.

**Participation**: Stabilise development process after team restructuring. Manage,
prioritize, highlight, and fix tech debts. Improved knowledge sharing. Unified
and refactored the code, replaced the chaotic layout with a new specialized for
the project system and created dozens of new abstractions and generic
components. Perform a large refactoring of generating docx reports.

## Sperasoft, Senior Software Engineer

- Dec 2020 - Sep 2021
- St Petersburg, St Petersburg City, Russia
- TypeScript, React, Node.js, Java

Worked on a platform for publishing games and was responsible for developing
different services: store, profile, and SSO login page; each is a separate web
application created using the BFF pattern and with custom SSR. I have increased
the quality of the code base by applying best practices and TypeScript, tuning
and improving SSR mechanisms. In parallel, I lead the development of the custom
application for managing CD processes. Migrated webpack from version 2 to 3,
significantly reduced the complexity of builds and moved dev builds to esbuild;
as a result, improved considerably developer's experience.

We also developed a landing website, where each page is a different application
with unique styles in one mono repository. Content is populated dynamically via
GraphQL. Improved and redesigned the mono-repository architecture and added new
features and complex UI elements to the custom component library.
