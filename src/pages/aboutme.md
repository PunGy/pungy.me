## **Professional Experience**

### **Open Source**

**REROI** - [github.com/PunGy/reroi](https://github.com/PunGy/reroi)

*Creator & Maintainer*

* Architected and implemented a high-performance reactive programming library
from first principles in TypeScript, exploring novel approaches to fine-grained
state management.
* Introduced such features as ACID-compliant transactional updates, and
prioritized scheduling, to solve complex state synchronization challenges.

### **Yandex** | Moscow, Russia
**Senior Software Engineer** | Oct 2023 - Present

Core R&D engineer on a greenfield project to build an innovative, browser-based
office package and especially a word processor designed to outperform all
existing solutions.

*   **Spearheaded the architecture for the desktop version** (Electron),
ensuring code reuse and maintaining feature parity with the web-based
application, successfully prototyping and validating a hybrid architecture for
a local-first environment.
*   **Invented and formalized a novel Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** on top
of TypeScript to manage and query complex document selection states, proving
its ability to reduce the logical complexity, prevent entire classes of
state-related bugs, and enabling developers to add complex new selectable
objects (e.g., tables, embedded media) in under a day.
*   **Engineered a platform-agnostic DevTools and state inspection library**
from scratch, enabling real-time modification and debugging of the application
state and graphics, similar to Pixi.js DevTools. It makes possible to find and
inspect bugs in seconds and provide interactive way to develop and test new
features.
*   **Implemented a non-indexing, asynchronous full-text search engine**
capable of querying 1M+ characters across a nested document tree in under 300ms
on low-spec hardware, while maintaining a 60fps typing experience.

### **EPAM Systems** | Kraków, Poland
**Senior Software Engineer** | Oct 2021 - Oct 2023

*Project 1: Embedded Smart-TV OS*
*   Architected and implemented core abstractions for managing asynchronous UI
operations on a large-scale embedded Node.js application, improving system
stability and predictability.
*   Overhauled and stabilized critical low-level utility modules, increasing
test coverage by 30% and shipping a benchmark library to prevent performance
regressions.
*   Maintained a suite of developer tooling (Bash) which automated device
connection and code deployment.

*Project 2: Security & Resource Management Platform*
*   Led technical stabilization efforts after a team restructure by triaging
and prioritizing the technical debt backlog, which unblocked feature
development for a team of 6 engineers.
*   Drove a major code unification effort, deprecating a chaotic layout system
in favor of a new, purpose-built component architecture, creating dozens of
reusable abstractions that accelerated future development.

*Mentorship*: Mentored groups of engineers in advanced software design courses.
Revamped the company's largest Computer Science course, directly improving the
technical education for hundreds of engineers.

### **Sperasoft** | St Petersburg, Russia
**Senior Software Engineer** | Dec 2020 - Oct 2021

Architected services for a game publishing platform (Store, SSO, Profile) using
a BFF and custom server-side rendering (SSR) engine.

*   Owned the migration of the primary build system from Webpack 2 to 4 and
integrated esbuild for development, decreasing average build times by 200% and
significantly improving the developer experience.
*   Redesigned the monorepo architecture for a multi-app landing site,
improving build isolation and enabling dynamic content population via a central
GraphQL API.

### **BuildSafe Sweden** | St Petersburg, Russia
**Senior Software Engineer** | Aug 2020 - Nov 2020
