## **About Me**

I'm a software engineer driven by a passion for building complex systems from first principles. I thrive on the challenge of turning theoretical concepts into tangible, high-performance software, and I'm most at home architecting novel solutions from the ground up. This journey has led me to design and implement everything from a word processor built for extreme performance to the core UI of an embedded TV OS. My work is about crafting elegant, robust, and efficient solutions to foundational problems in software.

## **Professional Journey**

My career has been a progression from building applications to building the platforms and systems they run on.

### **Open Source**

**REROI** - [github.com/PunGy/reroi](https://github.com/PunGy/reroi)

As Creator and Maintainer, this project is my exploration into the frontiers of reactive programming. I architected and built a high-performance library from scratch in TypeScript, developing novel approaches to fine-grained state management. This included implementing features like ACID-compliant transactional updates and prioritized scheduling to solve complex state synchronization challenges.

### **Yandex** | Moscow, Russia
*Senior Software Engineer* | Oct 2023 - Present

I am a core R&D engineer on a greenfield project to build an innovative, browser-based office package, with a focus on a word processor designed to outperform existing solutions.

### **EPAM Systems** | Kraków, Poland
*Senior Software Engineer* | Oct 2021 - Oct 2023

During my time at EPAM, I tackled large-scale systems challenges for two distinct projects.

*   On an **Embedded Smart-TV OS**, I architected core abstractions for managing asynchronous UI operations within a large Node.js application, significantly improving system stability. I also led an effort to overhaul critical low-level utilities, increasing test coverage by 30% and shipping a benchmark library to prevent performance regressions.
*   For a **Security & Resource Management Platform**, I stepped in to lead technical stabilization after a team restructure. By triaging the technical debt backlog, I unblocked feature development for the team. I also drove a major code unification effort, replacing a chaotic layout system with a purpose-built component architecture that accelerated future development.

**Mentorship & Education:** A fulfilling part of my role was mentoring engineers in advanced software design. I also revamped the company's largest Computer Science course, directly improving the technical education for hundreds of my peers.

### **Earlier Career** | 2016 - 2021

My earlier roles at **Sperasoft**, **BuildSafe**, **Luxoft**, and **Hyperauto**, along with my freelance work, built the foundation for my current focus. Highlights include:

*   Architecting a custom React Server-Side Rendering (SSR) engine and migrating a build system to esbuild, decreasing build times by 200%.
*   Leading a performance initiative that cut bundle size by 20% and measurably improved Web Vitals.
*   Architecting and delivering a PoC for a large-scale data-set processing pipeline, presented at CES 2020.
*   Introducing modern DevOps practices (Docker, Git) to a legacy environment, automating deployment and saving significant developer time.

## **Education**

**Vladivostok State University College** | 2016 - 2019

*   Studied Programming and Computer Systems
